# BIS15W2022_eparis 
Hello! This is the location where my work for BIS15L will be going.

## Introduction
My name is Ellyn Paris and I am a second year WFCB major at UC Davis. I decided to take this course in order to learn more about the programming language R in hope that I can implement my knowledge in my future work researching wildlife conservation. I am very new to the world of coding, but am excited to hone my skills and learn more about this field!
